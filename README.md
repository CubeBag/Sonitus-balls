# Headphonify
Work in progress...
Please try at your own risk, this code is untested and is currently only partially functional.
This tweak is very similar to Sonyfy (my other tweak) but excludes the need for the app, and might support other headphones in the future.

Bring the noise cancellation control of your headphones to the built-in iOS menu.

# Headphones/earbuds that will get support (currently being worked on)
WH-1000XM3, WF-1000XM4, Bose QC35, Bose NC700, Anker SoundCore Q30. Would you like to see other headphones supported as well? Open an issue (or open a pull request), or DM me on Twitter.

# How does it work?
It sends specific noise cancellation information to your headphones.

# Does it work with other noise cancellation tweaks?
Yes! Headphonify should work just fine with other noise cancellation (automation) tweaks, because it emulates the behavior of the official Airpods pro.

# Does it work with my headphones?
Headphonify is currently in development.


Let me know if your device is supported but I haven't put it on the list yet :)
